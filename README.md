### Pinned Projects  

**HackOHIO 2025 – SmartParking**  
HackOHIO is Ohio State’s largest 24-hour hackathon. My team built SmartParking, a full-stack web application that visualizes real-time campus parking availability. I worked on the Node.js APIs, React frontend, and a Python + OpenCV MobileNetV3 model that detects open parking stalls with 98% accuracy. We placed 2nd out of 190 teams.  

**Data I/O – Campus Energy Analytics**  
Data I/O is OSU’s annual data-focused hackathon. I built a campus energy analytics dashboard with weather-driven ML prediction. The project includes a React + TypeScript frontend for CSV uploads and visualization, and a Python (pandas, scikit-learn) prediction API that forecasts electricity usage using temperature, precipitation, and wind speed.  

**meli – Music Rating App (In Progress)**  
Currently building a mobile app that allows users to rank and compare music they’ve listened to. The app integrates with the Spotify API and is being developed in Android Studio using Kotlin.  

**Sleep Tamagotchi – Wear OS Internship Project**  
Developed during my internship in Japan, Sleep Tamagotchi is a Wear OS app built in Godot to encourage healthier sleep routines. I integrated biometric sensors (steps, light, heart rate) through custom Java + Android SDK plugins and designed modular systems for quests and data persistence.
